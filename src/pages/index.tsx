            Through leveraging my vast UI/UX engineering expertise and a
            certification in cloud engineering as an AWS Solutions Architect
            Associate, I create innovative, user-friendly digital experiences
            that enhance customer experience across all touchpoints.

            In my diverse career, I've founded and developed the Masumi Hayashi
            Foundation, worked on large-scale client websites at Agency.com, and
            delivered complex licensing contracts at Oracle Corporation. I've
            also designed 3D motion graphics for ESPN's international coverage
            and resolved critical defects in e-commerce applications.

            fading in sequentially. Another idea could be to have a 'typewriter'
            animation for the introductory text.
